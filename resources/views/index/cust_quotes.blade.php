Your vehicles are clean, and in excellent repair.  I really enjoyed our conversation and appreciate you answering all my touristy questions!  I wish you continued success, and highly recommend your company."</blockquote>

You took plenty of time to consider all the options and kept your cool throughout. We all felt completely looked after, and were thoroughly impressed! Glad to be back in the warm and dry. Hopefully your trip back was hassle free and safe as houses x"</blockquote>
